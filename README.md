# programming-fundamentals-for-data-science

This is a collection of exercises and small projects made in Python. 

Most of them were made while studying for my Data Science master's degree.

## Installation

Use any IDE to open and run the Jupyter Notebook files (ipynb), I recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Contributing
Suggestions to improve my code are welcome. Please avoid opening an issue to discuss minor changes.
